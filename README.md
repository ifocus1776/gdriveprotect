# Google Drive Sensitive Data Scanner (GDriveProtect)

A comprehensive Google Cloud application that automatically scans Google Drive files for sensitive data types (PII, SPII, SSN, credit card numbers) and securely stores identified sensitive documents in an encrypted vault.

## üîç Features

- **Automated Sensitive Data Detection**: Uses Google Cloud DLP API to identify PII, SSN, credit card numbers, and other sensitive data
- **Secure Vault Storage**: Automatically moves sensitive documents to encrypted Cloud Storage with customer-managed keys
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitors Google Drive changes and triggers automatic scans
- **Compliance Ready**: Built with GDPR and HIPAA compliance considerations
- **Comprehensive API**: RESTful API for integration with existing systems
- **Web Dashboard**: Simple web interface for monitoring and management

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a serverless, event-driven architecture using Google Cloud Platform services:

- **Google Drive API**: File access and change monitoring
- **Google Cloud DLP API**: Sensitive data detection and classification
- **Cloud Storage**: Secure vault for sensitive documents
- **Cloud KMS**: Customer-managed encryption keys
- **Flask Application**: RESTful API and web interface
