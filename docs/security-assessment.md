This approach ensures that even if one security control fails, additional layers continue to protect the data and maintain system integrity.

**Application Layer Security**: The application layer implements secure coding practices, input validation, output encoding, and comprehensive error handling to prevent common vulnerabilities such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting, and data exposure through error messages. All user inputs are validated and sanitized before processing, and all outputs are properly encoded to prevent malicious code execution.

**API Security**: Our RESTful API implements OAuth 2.0 authentication with Google's identity platform, ensuring that only authorized users and applications can access the service. API endpoints are protected with rate limiting, request validation, and comprehensive logging to detect and prevent abuse. All API communications use HTTPS with TLS 1.3 encryption and certificate pinning for enhanced security.

**Data Layer Security**: At the data layer, we implement encryption at rest using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) through Google Cloud Key Management Service. All data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.3, and sensitive data is tokenized or pseudonymized where possible to reduce exposure risk. Database access is restricted through network-level controls and requires multi-factor authentication.

**Infrastructure Security**: The underlying infrastructure leverages Google Cloud Platform's security controls, including network isolation through Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), firewall rules that implement least-privilege access, and continuous security monitoring through Google Cloud Security Command Center. All infrastructure components are hardened according to industry best practices and undergo regular security assessments.

### 1.2 Zero-Trust Architecture

GDriveProtect implements zero-trust architecture principles, assuming that no user, device, or network location should be trusted by default. Every access request is verified and authenticated before granting access to resources.

**Identity and Access Management**: All users and service accounts are authenticated through Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) with multi-factor authentication required for administrative access. Access permissions are granted based on the principle of least privilege, with regular reviews and automated deprovisioning of unused accounts.

**Network Security**: Network access is controlled through micro-segmentation using Google Cloud VPC networks and firewall rules. All network traffic is encrypted and monitored, with anomaly detection systems in place to identify suspicious activity patterns. Network access is granted on a need-to-know basis with time-limited access tokens.

**Device Security**: All administrative access requires managed devices with endpoint protection, encryption, and compliance with organizational security policies. Device certificates are used for additional authentication, and all device access is logged and monitored for security events.

### 1.3 Data Classification and Handling

GDriveProtect implements a comprehensive data classification system that categorizes data based on sensitivity levels and applies appropriate security controls for each classification.

**Public Data**: Non-sensitive information such as system documentation and public marketing materials. Standard security controls apply with basic access logging and encryption in transit.

**Internal Data**: Organizational information that should not be publicly disclosed but does not contain sensitive personal information. Enhanced access controls and audit logging apply, with encryption at rest and in transit.

**Confidential Data**: Sensitive business information and personal data that requires protection under privacy regulations. Advanced security controls include customer-managed encryption, detailed audit logging, access approval workflows, and data loss prevention monitoring.
